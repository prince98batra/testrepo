## üìò What is Maven?

Maven is a powerful build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It helps developers manage:

Project builds (compiling and packaging code)

Dependencies (external libraries)

Testing and Reporting

Deployment

It uses an XML configuration file called pom.xml (Project Object Model), where you define your project details, dependencies, plugins, and build lifecycle.

## üõ†Ô∏è How Maven Works (Simple Explanation)

When you run a Maven command, it follows a lifecycle to perform actions like compiling code, running tests, and creating a JAR or WAR file.

For example:

You write code in src/main/java

You write tests in src/test/java

Maven compiles the code, runs tests, and packages it as a deployable file using pom.xml instructions.


## ‚úÖ **Commonly Used Maven Commands**

---

### 1. **Clean compiled files**

- **Command:** 

```
mvn clean
```
Expected Output
```
[INFO] Deleting /path/to/project/target
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

- **Purpose:** Deletes the `target/` directory, where all compiled files and packaged files are stored.  
- **When to Use:** This command is used before building fresh code to ensure no old or unnecessary files remain. It is helpful when you want to start from scratch and avoid using old build files.

---

### 2. **Compile the project**

- **Command:** 

```
mvn compile
```  
Expected Output
```
[INFO] Compiling 1 source file to /path/to/project/target/classes
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

- **Purpose:** Compiles the source code located in the `src/main/java` directory into bytecode.  
- **When to Use:** Use this command to check if your Java code has any compilation errors. It helps to ensure that the code is free of syntax issues before further processing.

---

### 3. **Run unit tests**

- **Command:** 
```
mvn test
```  
Expected Output
```
[INFO] Running com.example.projectname.TestClass
[INFO] Tests run: 5, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.012 sec
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

- **Purpose:** Executes unit tests located in the `src/test/java` directory using a testing framework (like JUnit).  
- **When to Use:** Run this command to validate the core logic of your project by running unit tests. This ensures that individual components of your application work as expected.

---

### 4. **Create a JAR/WAR**

- **Command:** 

```
mvn package
```
Expected Output
```
[INFO] Building jar: /path/to/project/target/project-name-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

- **Purpose:** Packages the compiled code into a deployable `.jar` or `.war` file (as specified in the `pom.xml`).  
- **When to Use:** Use this command when you're ready to create a deployable file, such as when preparing the application for deployment or distribution.

---

### 5. **Install the Project Locally**

- **Command:**
```
mvn install
```
Expected Output
```
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

- **Purpose:** Compiles, runs tests, and installs the built artifact (e.g., .jar, .war) into the local Maven repository (~/.m2/repository).
- **When to Use:** Use this when you want to install the project locally for use in other projects or for further testing.

---

### 6. **Deploying the Project**

- **Command:**
```
mvn deploy
```
Expected Output
```
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

- **Purpose:** Deploys the packaged artifact to a remote repository (e.g., Nexus, Artifactory), making it available to other developers or projects.
- **When to Use:** Use this when you want to share your artifact with other projects or teams by deploying it to a remote repository after a successful build.

---

### 7. **Validate the Project**

- **Command:**
```
mvn validate
```
Expected Output
```
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

- **Purpose:** Validates the project‚Äôs configuration and checks for potential issues, ensuring that everything is correctly set up (i.e., POM file, dependencies).
- **When to Use:** Use this command when you want to verify that your project is correctly configured and doesn't have any major configuration or dependency issues.

---

### 8. **Run integration tests**

- **Command:** 
```
mvn verify
```  
Expected Output
```
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```
- **Purpose:** Runs the full test lifecycle, including unit tests and integration tests, and validates the build.  
- **When to Use:** Use this command before the final deployment of the project to ensure that all components work together and the build is ready for release.

---

### 9. **Download all dependencies**

- **Command:** 
```
mvn dependency:resolve 
``` 
Expected Output
```
[INFO] Downloaded: junit:junit:4.13.2
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

- **Purpose:** Downloads all libraries and dependencies specified in the `pom.xml` file.  
- **When to Use:** Use this command when you are setting up the project for the first time or if Maven cannot find the required dependencies. It ensures that all necessary libraries are available for your project.

---

### 10. **Print all dependencies**

- **Command:**
```
mvn dependency:tree
```
Expected Output
```
com.example.projectname:project-name:jar:1.0-SNAPSHOT
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ junit:junit:jar:4.13.2:test
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ org.springframework:spring-core:jar:5.3.8
```
- **Purpose:** Displays a tree structure of all project dependencies, including transitive dependencies.  
- **When to Use:** Use this command when you need to examine or debug dependency issues. It helps you understand the entire structure of your project‚Äôs libraries and their versions.

---

### 11. **Clean and build the project**

- **Command:** 
```
mvn clean install
```
Expected Output
```
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```
- **Purpose:** Cleans previous builds, compiles, runs tests, and installs the packaged artifact into your local Maven repository.  
- **When to Use:** This command is used to perform a complete build process. It‚Äôs the most commonly used command to ensure the project is fresh, compiled, and installed correctly in your local repository.

---

### 12. **Skip tests during build**

- **Command:** 
```
mvn install -DskipTests
```
Expected Output
```
[INFO] Tests are skipped.
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```
- **Purpose:** Builds and installs the project but skips running tests.  
- **When to Use:** Use this command when you need to quickly build and install the project without running tests, typically during development. However, **skipping tests is not recommended for production builds.**

---

### 13. **Run a specific test**

- **Command:** 
```
mvn -Dtest=ClassName test
```  
Expected Output
```
[INFO] Running com.example.projectname.TestClass
[INFO] Tests run: 1, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0, Time elapsed: 0.005 sec
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS

### 4. **Force Maven to Update Dependencies**

- **Command:**  
  ```bash
  mvn clean install -U
  ```

- **Expected Output:**  
  ```bash
  [INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
  ```

- **Purpose:**  
  This forces Maven to download the latest versions of the libraries from the internet, even if it already has a copy in its local storage.

- **When to Use:**  
  Use this when you think Maven has old or outdated libraries stored and you need to update them.

---

### 5. **Check Your Maven Version**
