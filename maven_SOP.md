## üìò What is Maven?

Maven is a powerful build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It helps developers manage:

Project builds (compiling and packaging code)

Dependencies (external libraries)

Testing and Reporting

Deployment

It uses an XML configuration file called pom.xml (Project Object Model), where you define your project details, dependencies, plugins, and build lifecycle.

## üõ†Ô∏è How Maven Works (Simple Explanation)

When you run a Maven command, it follows a lifecycle to perform actions like compiling code, running tests, and creating a JAR or WAR file.

For example:

You write code in src/main/java

You write tests in src/test/java

Maven compiles the code, runs tests, and packages it as a deployable file using pom.xml instructions.


## ‚úÖ **Commonly Used Maven Commands**
